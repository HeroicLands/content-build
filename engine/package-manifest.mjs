/**
 * The Foundry-package-id drift guard.
 *
 * {@link foundryPackageId} is *configured* in `content-build.config.yaml`
 * rather than read from the manifest, so the link resolver stays filesystem-free and
 * unit-testable — which means nothing keeps it in step with the `id` the
 * repository actually ships. Every compendium UUID the compilers emit takes its
 * first segment from that constant, so a drifted value emits a whole pack of
 * documents addressing a package that does not ship them: links that look
 * resolvable and fail at runtime (#1498, #1503).
 *
 * The check is split the same way for the same reason: {@link
 * assertPackageIdMatchesManifest} is a pure comparison of two strings, and
 * {@link readManifestPackageId} is the thin caller that feeds it from disk.
 *
 * The module has no import-time side effects, so it can be imported by the pack
 * library, by a CLI, or by a test without pulling a build along with it.
