/**
 * **The resolved item-type registry** — the consuming repository's
 * `itemBuilders` table, and the type whitelist derived from its keys.
 *
 * Both are read from the one resolved configuration, so they are literally the
 * same object's keys and values: a type cannot be whitelisted for compilation
 * without the builder that compiles it, which is the guarantee #1504 exists
 * for. The Item compiler dispatches through {@link itemBuilder}, so the table a
 * consumer configured is the table its notes compile with — the whitelist and
 * the dispatch used to come from different places, and a consumer supplying its
 * own registry got the types it asked for and the builders it did not (#1563).
 *
 * **The registry itself is a consumer's, and stays a leaf.** SoHL's lives in
 * `@heroiclands/content-build/sohl/item-builders`; the consumer names it in
 * `content-build.config.mjs`. That module must never read the resolved
 * configuration — the config file imports it, so a read from there would close
 * a cycle around the config's own evaluation. Data travels *into*
 * configuration; only modules like this one, which nothing in a config file
 * imports, read back out of it.
 *
